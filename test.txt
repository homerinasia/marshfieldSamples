git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/Hello-World.git

You need to replace "yourusername" with—you guessed it—your GitHub username. For me, it'd look like this:

git remote add origin https://github.com/gittest1040/Hello-World.git

This command tells git where to send your Hello-World repository. Now all you need to do is send it:

git push origin master
